# StravaDark

The open source Chrome Extension that adds a dark theme to Strava.com

## Setup
1. Clone the repo and run 'npm install' in that directory.
2. Go to Chrome > Manage extensions. Enable developer mode then click load unpacked and select the 'dist' directory.
3. Run the 'sass:watch' gulp task. This will watch the scss files and compile and minify them into one css file every time you save.
4. Make changes to the code.
5. Reload the extension on the Manage Extensions page.
6. Refresh strava.com to see your changes.
